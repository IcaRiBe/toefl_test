<p>The only way to be better at reading comprehension is <strong>reading</strong>.</p>
<p>You can read, at least, fairy tales to get used to read in that language.</p>
<p>Also if you are an slow reader just like me (even in my native language) you can put much more effort in this section reading any book, paper or news that appears in front just to make yourself a faster reader to <strong>succeed</strong> in your goal of finishing this section on time.</p>
